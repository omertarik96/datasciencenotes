## Supervised
- Done in the context of classification
- Common algorithms in supervised learning include logistic regression, naive bayes, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and random forests.


## Unsupervised

- To learn the inherent structure of our data without using explicitly-provided labels
- Common algorithms include k-means clustering, principal component analysis, and autoencoders.
