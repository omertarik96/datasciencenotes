# Dimensionality Reduction in Supervised Learning: Feature Selection

We should select the most and least important feature.

::: tip
A process that chooses an optimal subset of features according to a objective function.
:::

## Objectives
- To reduce Dimensionality and remove noise
- To improve mining performance

## Feature Selection Methods
- Embedded
- Filter
- Wrapper

### Embedded
::: tip
a machine learning algorithm that returns a model using a limited number of features
:::
They are a part of induction algorithms

### Filter

They are separate processes from the induction algorithms

### Wrapper

They are also separate processes from induction algorithm but they use induction algorithm as a subroutine
