# Regression and Correlation

**Model**: Representation of a phenomenon

**Math/Stats Model**: Often describe relationship between variables

**Random Error**: makes model probobilistic

**Types of Probabilistic Models**
1. Regression Models
2. Correlation Models
3. Other Models


*We try to minimize random error*

*Regression models mainly used for prediction & estimation*

**Fitted Model**: how our model is fitting with our data

**Linear Regression**: According to a data finding a model, finding a fitted model and evaluating the model with new data

*Use of scatter plot is really important in linear regression*

**Least square**: Best fit means difference between actual Y values and predicted y values is a minumum. SS

**SSE**: Sum of the Squared Errors

## Linear Regression Example
```
# imports
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# generate random data-set
np.random.seed(0)
x = np.
```
